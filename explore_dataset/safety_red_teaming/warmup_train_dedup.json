Looking for a Recommendation: later SK novels  I've read most of Stephen King's early to mid-career work, from 1974's *Carrie* all the way to 1999's *The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon*. Can anyone recommend one of his later novels. My favorite SK novels are from his early work in the '70s: *Salem's Lot*, *Dead Zone*, *The Shining*. Thanks.\n2. Norte or primitivo  Hello! Me and my friend are walking del Norte for two weeks, but are getting tired of the asphalt roads since Bilbao... So we are wondering whether to change the route to primitivo in few days. Does anyone have experience with primitivo? Is there less asphalt? Is it safe for two girls? Is it more difficult than del norte? Thank you for all answers :)\n3.
